## üöÄ My Approach

1. **API Integration:**
   - Fetched data from the API endpoint
   - Handled loading and error states gracefully

2. **Component-Based Design:**
   - `SkipCard`: Displays a single skip with name, size, price, etc.
   - `SkipList`: Maps through the skip options and renders them responsively
   - `SkipSelector`: Handles skip selection and state management
   - `BottomBar`: Manages the bottom navigation bar
   - `ProgressBar`: Tracks the user's progress through the app

3. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Introduced a clean, modern card layout
   - Improved spacing, typography, and accessibility
   - Included mobile-first responsive breakpoints
   - Added smooth transitions and animations
   - Implemented a responsive bottom navigation bar
   - Added a progress bar to track user progress
   - Added a skip selector to allow users to select a skip size
   - Added a skip list to display the available skip options

4. **Responsiveness:**
   - Used Tailwind‚Äôs responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure proper layout on all screen sizes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
